# Flash virtual machine - AVM1

Memo of AVM1 bytecode.   
Every ActionScript statement is compiled by Flash into a couple of simple bytecode actions (AVM1).

```js
/*  Constant pool and global registers :
    Accessing variables is much slower than accessing registers, so you should
    store your most used variables there. */

```
